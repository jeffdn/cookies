FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN PLAYING WITH TRANSLATING COOKIES:
(OR INTEGRATING INTERNATIONALISATION INTO OUR MAKEFILE/BUILD SYSTEM)

Currently, our internationalisation work is quite shitty.
To generate a .po-file from the source, execute:

	xgettext -C -k_ src/*.c -o foo_lang.po
	
from within the root of the source directory.

Now edit that file to your liking.

To convert that into a .mo-file, execute:
	
	msgfmt foo_lang.po -o foo_lang.mo

And last but not least, to test your newly created .mo-file with cookies,
you have to have set up up a correct localedir-structure. For testing the
Danish translation of cookies, I had to do something along these lines:

	mkdir -p localedir/da_DK/LC_MESSAGES/
	cp da.mo localedir/da_DK/LC_MESSAGES/cookies.mo
	export COOKIE_I18N_LOCALEDIR=./localedir/
	export LC_ALL=da_DK
	./cookies
	
For more information on the subject, please consult the gettext manual. :-)
